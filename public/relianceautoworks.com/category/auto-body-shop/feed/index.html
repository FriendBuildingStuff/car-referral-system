										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Five Characteristics of a Dependable Auto Body Shop</h3>
<p>Are you looking for a new auto body shop to take your car to? If so, you might wonder what you should look for in a dependable dent repair shop. That’s why the technicians at Reliance Auto Works in Brooklyn, New York, are here to help.</p>
<p>Here are five characteristics of a top-notch collision repair shop.</p>
<ol>
<li>Satisfied Customers</li>
<p>When it comes to advertisements, word-of-mouth recommendations from satisfied customers are the best. If your friends or family recommend an auto body shop they trust, consider taking your vehicle there. Your loved ones will never steer you wrong. If you need more proof, you can do research online. Check out online reviews for shops in your area.</p>
<li>Honesty is the Best Policy</li>
<p>Despite living in New York, many residents still rely on their vehicles. That’s why it’s important to always take your car to an honest and dependable automotive body shop. A professional technician will never be a swindler. They’ll always clearly explain what repairs they need to make to your car and be upfront about costs. Always take your car to a team you trust.</p>
<li>Years of Experience</li>
<p>Auto-body repair isn’t a skill you can learn overnight. A quality shop will only hire the best of the best. Before making an appointment, ask the collision repair shop about their staff’s qualifications and experience. An auto accident repair shop is only as strong as its staff.</p>
<li>Quality Equipment</li>
<p>Whether you need paint correction or collision repair, a great auto body shop will always use the best equipment and materials in the industry. Nobody wants to pay for auto painting services only to have the paint chip off or bubble a week later.</p>
<li>Friendly Service</li>
<p>Great customer service is the name of the game. If the staff is rude or hard to get a hold of, take your vehicle elsewhere. We at Reliance Auto Works always make you feel cared for and comfortable.</p>
</ol>
